| 1. | 00:00 | Chicken Stock pot, water | 20 mins | Sause pan | Put stock pot in saucepan with water, heat to slow simmer | |
| 2. | 00:00 | Leaks, 1/2 (4 leaves) sage | 10 mins | chopping board, knife | Top / tail leaks, remove outer layer, cut into coins.  Once all leaks are cut, add them to saucepan to start softening. Finely dice the sage, then add to saucepan also | |
| 3. | 00:10 | Garlic, pecorno remano | 5 mins | chopping board, knife | Mince the garlic as thinly as you can, set aside on chopping board.  Grate the Pecorino romano on the finest side of grater, set aside on chopping board. | |
| 4. | 00:15 | - | 0 mins | Saucepan | Turn the heat off on the saucepan (with the stock, leaks, and sage). | |
| 5. | 00:15 | - | 5 mins | Dutch oven | Preheat dutch oven on medium heat for 5 mins | |
| 6. | 00:15 | Risotto rice, olive oil, butter | 5 mins | Dutch oven,  | Into dutch oven add the olive oil and butter.  Let bubble for a 30 seconds (maybe let the butter start to brown slightly, but no worries if not).  Add the risotto rice to the oil and butter, flatten the rice against the pot with the spatula.  Stir the rice every 30 seconds to let the rice start to brown slightly and absorb the oils / fats. | |
| 7. | 00:20 | Contens of saucepan, galic, sage, cheese | 20 mins | Dutch oven, saucepan, spatula, ladle | Ladle a spoon of the leak / sage / stock liquid (try not to include the leaks, as they may overcook in the dutch oven) into the dutch oven - this may splutter on first couple of additions.  Scrape the bottom of the dutch oven to pull up any fond.  Stir the rice until the liquid is absorbed, repeat this twice more (ladling of liquid into dutch over), then add the garlic, cheese, and rest of sage. ||
| 8. | 00:30 | Contens of saucepan | 15 mins | Dutch oven, saucepan, spatula, ladle | Continue ladling in the liquid from sauce pan (without the leaks!) and stir every every ~30 seconds to allow the rice to absorb the liquid evenly.  Repeat this every 2-3 miunutes depending on how quickly the rice absorbs the liquid. Once almost all reachable liquid (without leaks) has been added | |
| 9. | 00:45 | salt, pepper, cream, contents of sauce pan | 5 mins | Sause pan, dutch oven | Turn the heat off on the risotto, and taste it.  The rice should have a very slight crunch in the centre.  Does it need more salt?  No salt has been added so far because stock pots variy in salinty, and the cheese is salty.  Add salt to taste, then add the pepper and cream.  Stir through, and then add the leaks from the saucepan.  Stir through again for even distrubution and to break up and any clumps of leak.  | |
| 10. | 00:50 | The complete risotto | 0 mins | dutch oven | if you are happy, serve.  If the rice needs a little longer, cover the risotto for five and taste again. | |
